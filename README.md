# MoleculeOS

**MoleculeOS** is a minimalist, text-based monolithic operating system, developed in C++ by GitHub user *Lukenar11 (Luke Matthes)*.

The goal of this project is to create a clearly structured, modular learning and experimental system that makes the fundamental building blocks of an operating system understandable and comprehensible – hence the name *MoleculeOS*.

## Features (current / planned)
- Custom boot setup (BIOS, x86)
- Minimal kernel in C++
- Basic hardware initialization
- Text-mode output
- Interrupt handling (IDT)
- Additional subsystems to follow

## Documentation
Detailed technical documentation can be found in the **`docus/`** folder.

## Status
MoleculeOS is in an early development phase and serves as a learning and research project.
